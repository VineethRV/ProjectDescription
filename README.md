## Timetable Architect  
**Description:**  
A software solution that automates the process of creating timetables for colleges. This system reduces the time required to design timetables from a few weeks to just an hour or two.  

**Tech Stacks Used:**  
- Local Version: C#, C++  
- Online Version: Next.js, TypeScript  (In development)

## Solid/Liquid Dispenser  
**Description:**  
A dispenser designed to accurately dispense powders and liquids for chemistry labs. This project drastically reduced the machine's cost from several lakhs to just ₹1500. An offshoot of this project, the liquid-only dispenser, further reduced costs from ₹25,000 to just ₹20–30.  

**Tech Stacks Used:**  
- Mechanical Design: SolidWorks  
- Electronics and Control: Arduino, Embedded C, MIT app inventor
- Fabrication Techniques: 3D printing

## Filament Recycler  
**Description:**  
A cost-effective solution for recycling used 3D printer filament into reusable filament spools. This project focuses on sustainability and affordability, bringing the cost of filament recycling machinery to under $100.  

**Tech Stacks Used:**  
- Mechanical Design: SolidWorks  
- Electronics and Control: Arduino, Embedded C  
- Fabrication Techniques: 3D printing and laser cutting

## Mini Laser Engraver (Patent pending)  
**Description:**  
A 3D-printable laser engraver designed for small-scale applications. My contribution involved making the product fully 3D-printable and reinforcing its structure for better stability and durability. The project is currently patent-pending.  


**Tech Stacks Used:**  
- Mechanical Design: SolidWorks  
- Control: Arduino, laserGRBL  
- Fabrication Techniques: 3D printing

## Copilot for Doctors  
**Description:**  
A project designed to assist doctors by handling menial cases, allowing them to focus on critical and complex situations. This "copilot" speeds up consultations for trivial cases by providing initial diagnoses and summaries for review. Operated by a nurse, the app leverages Llama 3.1 with a custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to narrow down potential diagnoses and present a concise summary to the doctor.  

**Tech Stacks Used:**  
- AI Models: Llama 3.1, Custom RAG Model  
- Backend: Python, Flask  
- Frontend: React
